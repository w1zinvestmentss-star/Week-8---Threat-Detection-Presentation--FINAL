        <p>In the early days of cybersecurity, the strategy was simple: build a digital fortress. High walls, a strong gate, and a deep moat were all that mattered. But attackers have evolved, and so must our thinking.</p>

                <p>This strategy focuses all security on the perimeter. It assumes that if no one breaks down the front gate, the kingdom is safe. This approach is brittle and fails the moment a single attacker gets inside, whether through a secret tunnel (a zero-day exploit) or by tricking a guard (phishing).</p>

                <h3 className="font-bold text-2xl text-green-400 mb-2">Modern Thinking: "Assume Breach"</h3>
                <p>This strategy accepts the reality that determined attackers <span className="font-bold">will</span> get in. The new goal is to find them as quickly as possible, before they can steal the crown jewels. We need guards patrolling the castle grounds, not just standing at the gate. This is the core of threat detection.</p>
